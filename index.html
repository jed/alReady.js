    `Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>
    All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;And the mome raths outgrabe.<br>
    <br>
    "Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>
    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The frumious Bandersnatch!"<br>
    <br>
    He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Long time the manxome foe he sought --<br>
    So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;And stood awhile in thought.<br>
    <br>
    And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br>
    Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;And burbled as it came!<br>
    <br>
    One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br>
    He left it dead, and with its head<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;He went galumphing back.<br>
    <br>
    "And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br>
    O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;He chortled in his joy.<br>
    <br>
    `Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br>
    All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;And the mome raths outgrabe.
